# Blockchain-Project

This project is a very simple blockchain covering all the fundamentals to the algorithm and how it works.

A blockchain is essentially a list of blocks and these blocks contain transactions and each block will have a unique hash that can link the blocks together.

Blockchains are decentralised when it comes to storage meaning every device accessing a block will have its own unique version of it. This means if the blockchain is altered on one device, it wont affect the other copies.
