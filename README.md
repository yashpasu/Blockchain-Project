# Blockchain-Project

This project is a very simple blockchain developed in python covering all the fundamentals to the algorithm and how it works.
This project contains transactions of a made up cryptocurrency to recreate a real prurpose for blockchains

A blockchain is essentially a list of blocks and these blocks contain transactions and each block will have a unique hash that can link the blocks together.
Blockchains are decentralised when it comes to storage meaning every device accessing a block will have its own unique version of it. This means if the blockchain is altered on one device, it wont affect the other copies.

This uses the libraries 'csv' for reading transaction from a csv file and 'hashlib' to generate a unique hash.
